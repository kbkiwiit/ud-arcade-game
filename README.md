## Instructions

This is a clone of the classic arcade game Frogger.

The objective of the game is to get to the water without coming into contact with one of the enemy bugs. If one of the bugs gets you, it's game over and you have to start again.

Beware, not all bugs move at the same speed!

## Controls

Here are the player controls:

Up arrow key: Move player forward
Down arrow key: Move player backward
Left arrow key: Move player left
Right arrow key: Move player right

That's it!
